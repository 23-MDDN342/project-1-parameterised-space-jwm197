I have added a sketch of my idea. It is going to be a sidescrolling platformer in the vane of the chrome no internet game (but with obviously no player although I may add one if I get bored as an extra). The character will jump over fractal trees. There will be couds in the background and the whole art style will be reasonably colourless. This version shows a basic blocking of  wha tI want although i may lower the ground level.
