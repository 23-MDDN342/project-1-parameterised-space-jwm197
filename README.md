I have tried having the background move. This is too intense as the composition is now too focused on the ground. I tried a couple of different speeds and having it not the same as the trees looked weird but having it slower looked weird as it felt like it should be the same speed. I also tried playing with the colour of the sedgments but that didn't help with the issue.
