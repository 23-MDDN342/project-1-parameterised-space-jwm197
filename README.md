I fiddled around with the frame work to make the ground draw only once by not drawing the background which enabled me to draw smaller squares. As this is just a test the ship's light is not behind the ground anymore it shows but it can be fixed with maths. Except for that the design visually works well with what I want but it screws up the debugger and the recording won't record the ground. This gives me an effect I want while giving me the performance. I can sort this by saving out the noise as an image and loading it in to increase performance. This will mean that it won't be as flexible to update the ground. I will however try experimenting with the veroni pattern instead and see if that looks good before trying this.
