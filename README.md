I have experimented with easing on the ship using a couple of different functions. I think it looks good having an ease on the ship I like this as when I moved to working with a ship this is the effect i wanted to achieve. The ship going down I will keep linear as after experimenting with it I just found it looked weird. I am however doubting whether I should use easing at all here as I feel like it is less athetically pleasing compared to the linear jump.
