I have added a voronoi pattern to the ground. The fill of which is done with noise. I used the library https://github.com/Dozed12/p5.voronoi to do so so I didn't have to write heaps of code. I like the look of it much more than rectangles as those are far more generic however this will require more fiddling to get the seed for the random points and the size of the areas created by it right due to the edges looking a bit weird with the super small regions looking weird against the rest which are big. I think it would be worth checking if having far more points driving it and therefore creating more/smaller areas would make it look more interesting. It might also be worth adding movement to the ground but it might make it look too busy.
