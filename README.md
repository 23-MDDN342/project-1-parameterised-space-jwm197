I have increased the range of the lerp colour on the ground as it was a bit plain and borring and basically mostly looked just grey which was a bit too subtle. This has however increased the visibility of the squares making it look even more pixelated. I cannot decrease the pixel size here as it would mean the animation starts lagging when drawn every frame. 2 potential sollutions would be look into the veroni pattern as the ground as supposed to using the squares with noise and apply the noise to it or having the ground just drawn once in set up which should enable me to improve performance enough to decrease the pixel size but will require me to refactor the ufo light.
